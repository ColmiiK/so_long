# so_long

This project consists of creating a small 2D game using the `MLX42` graphical library.

### Mechanics

Using **WASD** to control a character on screen, you must collect all **cheeses** and then reach the **exit**. The bonus part of the project includes **enemies** that will kill the player if they touch them.

### Visuals

The project uses sprites from the game **Baba is you**, an amazing puzzle sokoban-like game. I hope this rendition of the project be a tribute to the original game.

### Compiling

You can try this project by cloning the repository and executing `make` in the root directory. Then, execute `./so_long maps/42.ber` to play the game. If you want to experience the game at its fullest, execute `make bonus` before running the game to see the animations and enemies in action.
